<h3>Childhood</h3>
<p>I was born in Pennsylvania and was adopted at birth by my parents who live in The County. I grew up in a loving family, and had the opportunity to participate in many activities such a basketball, arts and crafts, swimming, soccer, and tee-ball. I also became an avid reader during my childhood thanks to my parents and my sister who would read with me whenever I asked; I owe all of my successes to this fact.</p>
<h3>High School</h3>
<p>At Caribou High School, I was a very active student. I was Vice President of the Class of 2015 my freshman and sophomore years, and Class President my junior and senior years. I was a member of the World Languages Club, and was able to go on a short trip to Qu√©bec City. I was an Executive Council Member of my school's chapter of the National Honor Society. I emceed the Christmas Assembly my junior year. I served as the voice of my class; I gave speeches at Junior Exhibition, Class Night, Senior Banquet, and also gave the Valedictory Address at my high school graduation. I took Advanced Placement U.S. History, English Language Composition, English Literature Composition, and French. I was also a very active sports player; I played soccer, basketball and softball all four years of high school. I was captain of all three my senior year, and MVP'd three times for softball (I hit two home runs my senior year)!</p>
<h3>University</h3>
<p>After weighing my options, I decided to attend the University of Maine at Presque Isle to study Secondary Education with a concentration in English. However, I decided after two semesters, that education was simply not for me. I worked at a local after school program, and though I thoroughly enjoyed working individually with students on reading and vocabulary, I found I simply take issues and disturbances to close to heart. I felt like a failure if kids acted out towards me. Therefore, I decided to pursue a different degree, this time at the University of Maine.</p>
<p>I work at Cary Medical Center in housekeeping and laundry. I applied for the job so I would have money to pay for college, but little did I know that this insignificant job would have such an intense impact on my life. My boss has become my greatest mentor. He has inspired me to want to do great things, and come up with new and innovative ideas for the healthcare industry. Because of him, I decided to pursue a double major in marketing and management, as well as an MBA. </p>
<h3>Future</h3>
<p>Beyond obtaining my Bachelor's and Master's degrees, I don't have a concrete plan of what I want to do. I think that I want to work in the healthcare industry. I want to be able to go into a department, analyze it, and offer solutions to increase productivity and efficiency.</p>
