<h3>Greetings!</h3>
<p>I am a sophomore at the University of Maine double majoring in marketing and management. I was raised in Caribou, Maine, three hours north of Orono, where there is surprisingly more than simply moose and potatoes. Prior to UMaine, I attended the University of Maine at Presque Isle for one year to study secondary education with a concentration in the English language. However, I decided that education wasn't quite the right fit for me, so here I am! I recently began planning to enroll in the five-year MBA program. I haven't decided exactly what direction I plan on going with my degrees, but I am keeping an open mind and going with the flow. Thanks for stopping by! </p>
